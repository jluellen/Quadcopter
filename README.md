Quadcopter
==========

Files written in Python that runs the framework for a Quadcopter:

Current hardware:
* Raspberry Pi
* 1 Brushless outrunner motor
* 2x xbee S1


Need:
* Accelerometer and 3 axis gyro
* 4x Brushless electric motors
* 4 ESC's 
* 1 liPo battery
* Barometric sensor (for height)


The final hope for this project is to build a quadcopter, use a raspberry pi as the flight controller and have it all
controlled by a laptop using a xbee as well.
